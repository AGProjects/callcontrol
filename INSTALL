Call Control installation guide
-------------------------------


Call Control is an application that can be used together with OpenSER to
control the duration of SIP sessions.

OpenSER is a SIP Proxy/Registrar developed at http://www.openser.org
For details about the design and how it works please consult the README file.


Installation
------------

Prerequisites:
- OpenSER version 1.0 or newer
- python 2.3 or newer
- CDRTool 5.0 or newer

CallControl consists of two components:

1. call_control.so is the OpenSER module
2. callcontrol.py is the server doing the actual call control

Both components must run on the same machine where OpenSER runs. The call
control program can work together with CDRTool rating engine to obtain the
maximum session time based on subscriber balance and destination and deduct
the subscriber balance at the end of the session.
 

Installation of the Call Control server
----------------------------------------------------

Unpack the archive in /usr/local/ (all necessary files will be under the 
callcontrol/ subdirectory).

Rename callcontrol.ini.sample to callcontrol.ini and edit the various options
to match your environment. The configuration file has detailed explanations for
every option you can set.

Copy the startup script (depending on your platfrom) from
/usr/local/callcontrol/boot/ to /etc/init.d/callcontrol

Make the necessary symlinks in the rc?.d directories in etc if you want it to
start at boot time. For debian this can be easily accomplished by running:

update-rc.d callcontrol defaults 20 90 

Run as root: /etc/init.d/callcontrol start
