Description
-----------

Call Control is an application that can be used together with OpenSIPS to
limit the duration of SIP sessions.

The applications that can be build upon this functionality include prepaid
systems using an external rating engine (by default CDRTool rating engine is
used), for limiting the maximum call duration to a certain value or being
able to close calls in progress based on various rules.

Call Control can close a call in progress, by sending BYE messages to both
parties, if the call does exceed its specified time limit or if Call Control
receives a command to forcefully close the call from outside. It will
however not send these fake BYE messages if the call is normally terminated
by either party involved in the conversation, before the call maximum
allowed time is exceeded.

Call Control works together with MediaProxy >=2.0 to also terminate calls
that have timed-out because the RTP streams have stopped flowing without
BYE.
