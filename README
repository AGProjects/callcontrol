Description
-----------

Call Control is a prepaid application that can be used together with
OpenSIPS call_control module and CDRTool rating engine to limit the duration
of SIP sessions based on a prepaid balance. It can also be used to limit the
duration of any session to a predefined maximum value without debiting a
balance.

Call Control achieves this by maintaining a timer for each session and
sending BYE messages to both SIP end-points, if the session exceeds its
maximum session limit or if the Call Control receives a command to
forcefully close the call from outside.


Features
--------

 * Parallel sessions using one balance per subscriber
 * Support for sessions that have timeout without BYE
 * Support for sessions that have timeout for media (using MediaProxy)
 * Manual session stop from server terminal
 * Overview of ongoing sessions in the web page or server terminal
 * Graceful restart without loosing track of sessions 
 * Detailed logging of all performed actions using syslog
 * Web page provisioning for prepaid accounts (using CDRTool)
