callcontrol (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Migrating the entire application to python twisted.
  * Changed protocol between opensips call control module and call control
    application to use a persistent connection. Module sends a multiple
    CRLF-terminated line message, with a single empty CRLF-terminated line
    signaling end of message; the application responds with a single
    CRLF-terminated line.
  * Added commands to the call control opensips module - call control
    application which are used by the init script to show a list of
    sessions and session details.
