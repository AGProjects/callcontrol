Description: Call Control prepaid application for OpenSIPS
 Call Control is a prepaid application that can be used together with
 OpenSIPS call_control module and CDRTool rating engine to limit the duration
 of SIP sessions based on a prepaid balance. It can also be used to limit the
 duration of any session to a predefined maximum value without debiting a
 balance.
 .
 Call Control achieves this by maintaining a timer for each session and
 sending BYE messages to both SIP end-points, if the session exceeds its
 maximum session limit or if the Call Control receives a command to
 forcefully close the call from outside.
