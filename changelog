Changes from version 1.5.0 to 1.5.1

- Fixed missing import statement

Changes from version 1.4.2 to 1.5.0

- Migrating the entire application to python twisted.
- Changed protocol between openser call control module and call control
  application to use a persistent connection. Module sends a multiple
  CRLF-terminated line message, with a single empty CRLF-terminated line
  signaling end of message; the application responds with a single
  CRLF-terminated line.
- Added commands to the call control openser module - call control
  application which are used by the init script to show a list of
  sessions and session details.

Changes from version 1.4.1 to 1.4.2
-----------------------------------

- Fixed bug related to the radius table name introduced by previous release.


Changes from version 1.4.0 to 1.4.1
-----------------------------------

- Fixed bug where the radacct table name was locked to the value at
  startup time and calls that did timeout were no longer detected.


Changes from version 1.3.6 to 1.4.0
-----------------------------------

- Allow the username in contact to be missing. In such a case the
  username `unknown' will be used instead.
- Use canonical URI instead of translated request URI as destination.
- Send the source IP of the caller to the rating engine.


Changes from version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6
-----------------------------------

- Allow strftime like time specifications in the radacct table name


Changes from version 1.3.4 to 1.3.5
-----------------------------------

- First check if account is locked and then check if is has not enough
  credit, to avoid the locked state never being reported and always being
  masked by the "not enough credit" state.


Changes from version 1.3.3 to 1.3.4
-----------------------------------

- Send CallId as a parameter with the prepaid engine commands


Changes from version 1.3.2 to 1.3.3
-----------------------------------

- Default to openser instead of ser in the configuration


Changes from version 1.3.1 to 1.3.2
-----------------------------------

- Updated the ser module to work with openser-1.0.0


Changes from version 1.3.0 to 1.3.1
-----------------------------------

- Fixed issue with not sending BYE messages on calls that were externally
  closed (by mediaproxy on media timeout), because of a typo in the code


Changes from version 1.2.0 to 1.3.0
-----------------------------------

- Contact is now taken unmodified from the contact header (do not overwrite
  the IP:port from contact with the received IP:port - this was wrong).
- Pass from tag with an update command instead of old contact (which was
  received IP:port in this case). This will more precisely identify the
  endpoint (unlike any private/public IP:port matching would have)
- No longer pass via with any request. It's no longer used (the Via header
  sent by the embedded SIP client will use it's own address).
- Use tags to determine the endpoint in question for update commands
- Fixed problem with SIP asymmetric clients that lead to exceptions being
  raised when processing certain update requests (they couldn't be matched
  using the old IP:port matching technique).
- Determine the IP:port address what will be used by the SIP client in the
  Via header at startup based on the configuration options.
